An application created for a fictional skateboard company that sells its products online. Love skating, one of my ex-hobbies. Via this project I'm trying to motivate myself to start skating again, hopefully. 

Demo: https://youtu.be/dkDA2f176hc

# Requirements 
 - As an user I want the application to behave like a ordinary online shop
 - As an user I want to use the basic online shop functionality
 - As an user I want to see a detailed view of the selected items 
 - As an user I want to create and account, and log in my account 
 - As an user I want to see all the details of the selected item

# Optional (Not delivered)
- Search functionality
- Cart functionality 
- Payment functionality

Important Notes:
- The home page, after logging in requires the user to refresh the page in order for the items to be displayed on screen.

! The App layout is responsive but it was designed and teseted specifically on Pixel 4 and S21 Ultra !
